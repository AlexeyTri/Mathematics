LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, ..., wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation. LinearRegression takes in its fit method arguments X, y, sample_weight and stores the coefficients w of the linear model in its coef_ and intercept_ attributes.
