Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together efficiently through branching, merging, and conflict resolution. Key commands include git clone to copy repositories, git add to stage changes, git commit to save revisions, git push to upload changes, and git pull to download updates. Git maintains complete history, enables rollback to previous versions, and supports collaborative workflows through platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
